2 files to edit - starterCode.fxml (in the view package) and the Java controller StarterCode (in the controller package)

- The fxml file is there to add the components and is a little like HTML is terms of using tags for elements i.e. <HBox></HBox>
- The controller is there so we can respond to any user interactions (clicks) using Java code.

- To link the fxml file and the controller file there is an attribute on the outermost element of the fxml file called
fx:controller="" which gives the location of the controller.
- To respond to a click in the controller, we need to add an onMouseClicked="#methodName" attribute to the component in the
fxml that the user will click. A method called "methodName" (same as given in the onMouseClicked attribute, but no #) has to
be made in the controller class. Then when the fxml component is clicked, "methodName" will be called in the controller.

Some example components in the startercode to edit and make whatever you need for your task. Gridpanes are good to keep
everything looking orderly. If not sure about something send a message in the group chat.
